## üìù Introduction to Open Data Cube

We are currently building this page. In the meantime, you can refer to DEA documents about [their Open Data Cube](https://docs.dea.ga.gov.au/notebooks/Beginners_guide/02_DEA.html#).

### Background
### Satellite datasets in this Data Cube

### Analysis Ready Data

#### üõ∞Ô∏è Diwata-2 SMI Dataset
Diwata-2 is the second 50 kg. earth observation microsatellite of the Philippines built by researchers from the University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) and the Advanced Science and Technology Institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST-ASTI) in cooperation with Tohoku University and Hokkaido University in Japan under the Philippine Scientific Earth Observation Microsatellite (PHL-Microsat) Program. It was successfully deployed into 600 km SSO orbit on 29 October 2018 and carries the same optical cameras for scientific earth observation found in Diwata-1. It has since captured over 3,900 images total around the world, over 2,290 of which are of the Philippines (image count as of June 2019). Specifically, improvements in Diwata-2 include an Enhanced Resolution Camera (ERC) for pansharpening images captured by the SMI, experimental modules for attitude determination & sensing, and an experimental amateur radio unit (ARU) which can be used as an alternative mode of communication for emergency response.
